py_macro
========

Py_macro is an automation program by TJ Bearse. The program allows users to build a list of key commands which can be run by the program. This program simulates user key presses in a manner such that macros can be run on any program or across multiple programs.

Py_macro uses a wxPython user interface. Currently the key emulation functionality is limited to Windows environments.
